#### The way to create tables or connect to your db:
        for connecting to your db at the first you must create a dictionary
        called MY_DATABASE and fill it with your connection's information
        at the second you must call the create_table function to connect to your
        database and create tables.
        if you only want to connect to your db you must instead of create_table function
        call the connect_mysql function.
